# Revel Frontend Coding Challenge - Resume-o-Tron

Wow! We're so happy you want to work at Revel! üôå However, we want to review your skills to understand your level of expertise and whether you're a good fit for our team. Technically. You're already awesome.

We are looking for people that ‚ù§Ô∏è GraphQL and are feeling right at home mutating and querying against GraphQL APIs.

## The challenge

Make a beautiful, accessible resume viewer and editor! 

The following is already done for you:
- GraphQL API with Apollo Server
- Frontend routes for `/` and `/edit`
- React Apollo setup
- SCSS module setup
- Jest testing setup
- Basic resume display UI - hooked up to Apollo
- Basic form for editing the resume - hooked up to Apollo
- Written out test specs (with a few that are not implemented yet)

What we need from you:
- Create a component that will go into the form that allows you to submit an array of strings
  - This will be used to edit your _hobbies_
- Create a component (or use the same one from earlier if you prefer) to submit
    an array of _objects_
  - This will be used to edit your past jobs
- Ensure the tests pass
- Complete the tests that aren't finished yet
- Add nice error handling in the UI to let the user know when an error happens in a pleasant way
  - Hint: we pass you an `errors` array with messages with the mutation payload to
      display a clear message if something goes wrong
- Track how long you spend doing this, and write small, focused git messages
- Bonus: surprise us with any extra features if you have extra time! Some ideas
    could be:
    - Drag and drop for re-ordering the hobbies and jobs
    - Dark mode toggle switch
    - Integration tests with something like Cypress

## Getting started

1. Run `yarn start` in the root directory to install all of your packages and
launch the backend and frontend dev servers - that's it!

2. Then [open your browser](http://localhost:3000) (it will do this for you
   automatically, but adding note here for clarity).

## Running tests

```bash
yarn test
```

## Do's

- Focus your time on writing the component(s), beautiful mobile-friendly styling and finishing the
    tests before anything else - in that order
- Reach out to us early if you have any questions, get stuck or think it will take you longer than ~4 hours. We're a 100% remote team and _strong_ communication is extremely important to us
- Use whatever custom layout and styling you want! Just make sure it's
    mobile-friendly, accessible and has nothing to do with a _CSS framework_.

## Dont's

- Don't use a CSS framework (Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.)
- Don't spend too much time on this! You have 7 days to turn this in, but don't
    spend more than 4 hours or so on it
- Don't forget to track your time spent
- Don't touch the backend code (we wrote it for you so you can focus on the frontend üòâ)

## The FAQ

### Who will rate me?

Revel Engineers will rate you. Some will check on what you delivered and others will check on how you delivered it. They're all into quality, but also into seeing how much you can deliver in a short timespan.

### How do I give my solution to Revel?

**Zip up the folder when you're done with your work and send it back to alena@hellorevel.com**. We‚Äôll review it and be in touch with next steps.

Ready? Awesome! Let's get going! Hope to see you soon at Revel!
